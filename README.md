## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This project is the backend to an e-commerce site. The goal was to configure a functional Expressjs API to Sequelize so it can interact with a MySQL Database. This site will not be deployed, below is a link to a video demo of the app's functionality.  

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Starter code provided. NPM packages required: expressjs, dotenv, mysqlL2, sequelize, and nodemon. Insomnia Core for API testing. 

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

User must connect to mysql to source the schema file. The user can then return to the CLI and run the seed data to the database. Once that is done, the user is then able to start the server connection and test that the API is functional.

Below is a link to a video demo of this process followed by the testing of 
API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia:
